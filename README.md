Portfolio site was created using Bootstrap styling sheet along side a .css style sheet.

The layout is identical to my homework 1, although the code feels easier to work with
due to using boostrap for the majority of development

The contact page is still having issues with submission. The page will not refresh once you hit submit.

also the portfolio page will need to be updated to have clickable images that redirect to other pages in the future, preferably.
